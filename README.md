# IMAGE-PROCESSING-AND-FACE-RECOGNITION-WITH-MATLAB
## AN IEEE SPS EVENT ON IMAGE PROCESSING AND FACE RECOGNITION WITH MATLAB
## By Chethan Polanki 

This project was completed using the AlexNet Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. I presented this project in a webinar organized by IEEE SPS VIT, where I demonstrated it to junior members of the chapter as well as other research scholars.

The project was implemented in the Matlab software. Initially, I gathered a sample dataset and trained the model using the CNN. Subsequently, I conducted testing. The entire learning process took six minutes on my local computer.
